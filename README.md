3. **Who are the most valuable customers based on revenue contribution?**
4. **Are there any seasonal trends in sales performance?**
5. **How can we optimize inventory based on sales trends?**
6. **What is the average order value (AOV) per customer?**
7. **How frequently do customers make repeat purchases?**
8. **Which product categories have the highest profit margins?**

## 📂 Dataset Details

- **Dataset Name:** `sales_data.csv`
- **Source:** [Kaggle / Public dataset]
- **Columns:**
  - `order_id`: Unique identifier for each transaction
  - `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer
  - `order_date`: Date of the purchase
  - `category`: Product category
  - `product`: Name of the product
  - `quantity`: Number of items purchased
  - `price`: Price per unit
  - `sales`: Total revenue from the sale

## 📊 SQL Queries & Analysis

### 📌 1. Total Sales by Category

```sql
SELECT category, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

**Insight:** Identifies the highest-grossing product categories.

### 📌 2. Monthly Sales Trend

```sql
SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', order_date) AS month, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

**Insight:** Helps track revenue fluctuations and seasonal trends.

### 📌 3. Top 5 Customers by Revenue

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(sales) AS total_spent
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Insight:** Identifies high-value customers contributing the most to revenue.

### 📌 4. Average Order Value (AOV) Per Customer

```sql
SELECT customer_id, AVG(sales) AS average_order_value
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY average_order_value DESC;
```

**Insight:** Measures the average revenue generated per order.

### 📌 5. Repeat Purchase Frequency

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) AS purchase_count
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY purchase_count DESC;
```

**Insight:** Highlights customer retention and loyalty trends.

### 📌 6. Highest Profit Margin Categories

```sql
SELECT category, SUM(sales - (quantity * price * 0.6)) AS profit_margin
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY profit_margin DESC;
```

**Insight:** Determines which product categories generate the highest profits, assuming a 60% cost estimation.

## 📌 How to Run the Queries

1. Import `sales_data.csv` into a SQL database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.).
2. Execute the SQL queries in your preferred SQL environment.

## 📈 Results & Findings

- **Top-Selling Category:** Electronics generated the highest revenue.
- **Peak Sales Month:** November showed a significant revenue increase, likely due to holiday shopping.
- **High-Value Customers:** The top 5 customers contributed approximately 30% of total revenue.
- **Seasonal Trends:** Sales tend to rise toward the end of the year, supporting the need for seasonal marketing campaigns.
- **Inventory Optimization:** High-demand categories require additional stock planning to prevent shortages during peak sales periods.
- **Customer Insights:** The AOV and repeat purchase behavior provide valuable information for customer segmentation and loyalty programs.
- **Profit Margins:** Certain categories yield significantly higher profit margins, indicating areas for strategic pricing adjustments.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Implement more advanced SQL techniques (e.g., Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window Functions)
- Integrate data visualization tools such as Tableau or Power BI for better insights
- Perform predictive analysis using Python to forecast future sales trends
